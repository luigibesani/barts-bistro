              Our dough is made from four simple ingredients and fermented over
              24h, always. Itâ€™s how we recreate that dappled look time and time
              again.{" "}

              This labor of love creates a chewy and airy texture; our mark of a
              well-made focaccia. This fermented crust is lighter and healthier
              than your average bread, leaving you satisfied without feeling
              stuffed.
